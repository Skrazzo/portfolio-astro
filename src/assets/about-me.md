## Hi, I'm Leons

From a young age, I was captivated by technology and gaming. At the age of 10, I began scripting to automate tasks in games, which ignited my passion for programming and inspired me to learn C++ and C#.

During technical school, my focus shifted to web development. This evolution of interest shaped my career path, and today, I am a committed full-stack developer.
