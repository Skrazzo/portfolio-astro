I have had the pleasure of working with Leons Aleksandrovs on school projects, personal projects, and even real client projects. For example, we created a website for a local manor "Ruckas muiža". Leons is always an excellent team member in such projects. He is very systematic and punctual regarding work deadlines and quickly learns new systems and technologies when required. He also pays great attention to constructive criticism and takes an active role in discussions. Even the tightest schedule doesn’t prevent him from assisting others. He’s also a positive and easygoing person, making collaboration a breeze.
