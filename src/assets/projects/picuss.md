I got bored of not being able to find and sort images the way I wanted, that's how Picuss was born. Picuss let's you sort images by adding different tags to them.

Additional features that makes Picuss special are AI object recognition, fast and memory efficient, client-side image compression, image encryption, and it is made to be self hosted.
